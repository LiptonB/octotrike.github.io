question: Who's behind Trike?
---
Trike is a personal project of Brenda Larcom and Eleanor Saitta, and hopefully other individual developers in the future.  Both Brenda and Ella currently work for [Stach & Liu](http://www.stachliu.com/), which graciously allows the free flow of ideas to and from Trike and occasionally even funds some documentation or bug fixing, but does not control Trike.
