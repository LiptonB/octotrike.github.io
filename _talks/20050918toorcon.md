# Summary

From the conference brochure:

Trike is a repeatable, consistent, partially automatable methodology for
analyzing the security risk posed by a system. Threat models are particularly
useful for finding architectural and algorithmic holes in an application.
Trike builds a model of system threats, attacks, weaknesses, vulnerabilities
and risks on a model of the system requirements and implementation. In
version 1, system threats can be generated automatically given system
requirements, and a variety of questions about risk can be answered
programmatically.

Eleanor & Brenda will present version 1 of the Trike methodology by constructing
a sample threat model using the Trike tool. They will provide an overview of
the theory behind Trike as each relevant concept appears in the sample threat
model, and mention current lines of thought which may become part of version 2.

# Slides & Demo

We used two slide decks for this presentation: 
[Theory](Trike-ToorCon-2005-theory.ppt) and
[Examples](Trike-ToorCon-2005-examples.ppt).  The example slides begin
where our demo (of Trike v1 build 5) ended.

We also looked at an example file of [attack stubs](attackStubs.txt).
